              My work focuses on leveraging <strong>computational methods</strong> to better understand 
              <strong>human behavior, cognition, and social understanding</strong>.
              I’m especially drawn to projects that use data to support 
              <strong>self-reflection, identity exploration, and interpersonal understanding</strong>.

              For my <strong>Senior Independent Study</strong>, I analyze large-scale personality trait data 
              to construct theory-informed cognitive variables. I then apply 
              <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong> and simulation-based validation to examine 
              whether these variables reflect fewer underlying dimensions and what those dimensions may represent.
              <strong>This work explores how interpretable machine learning and statistical modeling 
              can be used to revisit and evaluate classic psychological frameworks.</strong>
              I will present this work at Wooster’s I.S. Symposium and as a poster at 
              <strong>NCUR (April 2026)</strong>.

              Outside of research, I’m deeply involved in STEM education and mentorship.
              As a <strong>STEM Success Initiative (SSI) Intern</strong>, I help plan and promote 
              programming that supports confidence and belonging for underrepresented students in STEM.
              I also work as a <strong>STEM Zone Intern</strong> and <strong>Teaching Apprentice</strong>, 
              supporting students through labs, office hours, and project-based courses in computer science.

              Beyond coursework and research, I serve as Vice President of the 
              <strong>Google Developer Student Club</strong> at Wooster. 
              In my free time, I enjoy video games, journaling, and watching various TV shows.

              <strong>I love research, teaching, and mentorship</strong>, and I’m excited by roles 
              that allow me to build interpretable, human-centered models.
              I’m particularly interested in work at the intersection of 
              <strong>behavioral data</strong>, <strong>cognition</strong>, and <strong>interpretability</strong> 
              — whether in research or applied settings.
