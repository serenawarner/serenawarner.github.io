              My research focuses on leveraging <strong>computational methods</strong> to support <strong>cognition and social understanding</strong>.
              I am particularly drawn to projects that use data to support <strong>self-reflection, identity exploration, and interpersonal understanding</strong>.

              For my <strong>Independent Study</strong>, I am using Big Five personality data to create proxy estimates for the eight Jungian cognitive functions.
              Using these measures, I run PCA to investigate whether the Jungian cognitive functions collapse into fewer dimensions and identify what those dimensions could represent, given the two frameworks applied.
              <strong>This work aims to explore how machine learning can potentially help revisit lost psychological theories and/or discover new ones.</strong>
              This project will be published by March 2026 by Open Works at the College of Wooster, and I will be presenting it at Wooster's I.S. Symposium.
              <strong>This work will be presented as a poster at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) for April 2026.</strong>

              Outside of research, I am constantly looking to support STEM education.
              I work as a <strong>STEM Success Initiative (SSI) Intern</strong> with the goal of increasing confidence in underrepresented students across STEM fields.
              Within SSI, I've also worked as a <strong>STEM Zone Intern</strong>, similar to a teaching assistant, assisting students in and out of introductory computer science courses.
              In my senior year, I have served as a <strong>teaching assistant</strong> in a first year seminar course, focused on exploring technology in society,
              and in the Junior Independent Study course, preparing juniors for their senior Independent Study.

              Outside the lab, I act as a student leader in the <strong>College of Wooster's Google Developer Groups</strong> as vice president.
              I spend my free time playing various video games, journaling, and watching different TV shows.

              <strong>I plan to pursue a PhD</strong> with a program that would allow me to continue and explore my research interests in cognitive science,
              computational neuropsychology, and interpretable AI modeling.
              I’m especially interested in interpretable models of human cognition and identity.
