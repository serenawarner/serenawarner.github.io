            <p>
                My research focuses on leveraging machine learning to enhance social understanding and 
                foster meaningful connections. I am particularly drawn to projects that use data to support 
                self-reflection, identity exploration, and interpersonal understanding, whether through 
                interactive AI systems or experimental prototypes.
            </p>

            <p>
                For my year-long Independent Study (Wooster's undergraduate thesis), I plan to apply 
                unsupervised machine learning to large-scale text data to discover patterns in cognitive 
                style and personality. The goal is to identify clusters that reveal how people process 
                and communicate information, then explore how those patterns relate to learning needs. 
                The work aims to inform the design of adaptive educational systems and accessibility 
                tools that can adjust to diverse cognitive profiles. This project will be published by 
                the end of my undergraduate experience, and I will be presenting it at Wooster's I.S. 
                Symposium.

            <p>
                Outside the classroom, I contribute as a STEM Success Initiative Intern, STEM Zone Intern, 
                teaching assistant, and student leader in organizations including Women's Club Rugby and 
                the Google Developer Student Club. I am passionate about creating technology spaces that are 
                intuitive, expressive, and centered on the human experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                I plan to pursue a PhD with a program that would allow me to continue and expand my current 
                research on cognitive styles and/or explore my other research interests in neurodivergence 
                experience and online miscommunication minimization.
