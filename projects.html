                <h2>üß† MBTI Text Classification</h2>
                <p>This Independent Study project applies supervised machine learning, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression, to classify Myers-Briggs personality types based on forum text. Instead of using the four-letter MBTI format, this project uses cognitive function theory, as introduced by Carl Jung and further developed by John Beebe, to model six different function-based classification schemes.</p>
                <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Python, NLP, SVM</p>

                <h2>üíâ Diabetes Diagnosis Analysis</h2>
                <p>For my Applied Statistics course, we had to do a project analyzing a dataset. I chose a dataset using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) focused on analyzing which medical and lifestyle factors can impact having a diabetes diagnosis. Through logistic regression, I found that diabetes diagnosis has relationships with age, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, physical activity, heavy alcohol consumption, and income.</p>

                <p>I worked with a partner in my Machine Intelligence course to complete a rugby match results prediction model. We explored different modeling, with our best performance done by the decision tree model. We were able to achieve a 75% accuracy with this model.</p>

                <h2>üéÆ Messy Room</h2>
                <p>In my Multimedia Computing course, I was tasked with creating a game using the Pygame library. With two partners, I created a game titled, "Messy Room," where items in a room were randomly placed and had to be sorted to different locations in a bedroom. The player has a limited time amount in order to complete the game.</p>
